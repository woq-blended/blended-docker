== Using the apacheds-alpine image

This image contains a preconfigured instance of an Apache Directory Service. Within blended, this
image is used only within inetgration tests whenever an integration needs to use authentication
against an LDAP server.

The `files/script` folder contains 2 files:

link:files/scripts/configure.sh[`configure.sh`]::
This script is used to set up the directory service with prepared content.

link:files/scripts/run.sh[`run.sh`]::
This script is used as an entrypoint into the docker image to start up the configured
directory service instance.

=== Using different logins and groups

It is possible to change or enhance the configured users and groups by modifying the `configure.sh`
script and rerun the docker build. Note, that the configuration takes place only at `docker build`
while `docker run` simply starts the server.

Below is the current configuration of users and groups
