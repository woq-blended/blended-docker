== The blended alpine base image

This image simply defines the base image on top of Alpine 3.9 and adds an user and a group.
The user and the group can be used in other images to manage access to mounted directories.

An example of such an usage is within the link:../build-alpine/ReadMe.adoc[build-alpine]
image.
